This demonstrates how the traffic data would look like, and this utilizes p5.js to connect the pins.

## Features
- Fetches live traffic data using a Maps API
- Visualizes traffic congestion and patterns using p5.js
- Provides an interactive interface for exploring different areas around UT Austin

## Technologies Used
- **Maps API**: For fetching traffic data and displaying the map
- **p5.js**: For rendering and animating traffic visualizations
- **JavaScript, HTML, CSS**: Core technologies for web development
